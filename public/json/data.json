Scientists are interested in understanding human behavior and this information can help reveal significant facts about human behavior in the face of reward and risk. The safe node has less resources but a higher chance of staying safe from disease outbreak. The risk node has more resources but a lower chance of staying safe from disease outbreak. With this data, psychologists and scientists can better understand risk aversion and risk-seeking behavior."

Users can decide to team up with other users in order to gain more collective resources.
