          <div>
<strong>Science Mode</strong>
              <p align="left">In science mode the user looks at data collected by users playing Disease.io. In order to get to science mode, click on the "Scientist" role option displayed on the front page. Download options are listed underneath the graphs, and the various different data graphs we have collected are listed on the left side of the page.</p>
<strong>Citizen Mode</strong>
<p align="left">In Citizen Mode the user plays the Disease.io game (and in the process collects data for science!). To get to citizen mode, click "Citizen" under role selection on the main page. Once you have clicked this, you will be taken to the main "map". On this map you will see two "Nodes", one is green, and the other is red. The green node represents a safe space to collect resources, while the red node represents a "Risky" area.</p>

<p align="left"> After clicking on a node and selecting your choice (or leaving on the default choice of "Safe") click on the "Enter Your Chosen City" button in order to begin playing the game. In the game, there are several elements to be aware of, while in the future these elements may be modified, for now we have a "Player", Joystick", "Team Button", and "Resources". The Joystick is the bottom-left element represented by a white sphere on top of a grey sphere. By moving the white sphere away from the grey sphere you "move" the joystick. The Player is represented by the red sphere, the dotted line surrounding it is the "team" area in which if it is green you will gain points by having neighbors. Team Button: The lower right grey button, if you click it you toggle "team mode" (Green is team mode, red is not team mode). In the future, while in team mode you will gain points when another player gathers resources in your "zone". Resources: The small white dots throughout the map, moving the red player over them causes them to pick them up and gain points. You can also click on the map to move the player to the clicked location. Additional information on how to play will be given to you in a video that pops up whenever you start the game that teaches you how the mechanics of the game works
